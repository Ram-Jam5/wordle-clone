***Wordle*** is a fun guessing game that anyone can play! (img of wordle website here) 
## How To Play
A 5-letter word will be chosen at random when you load the game. The goal of the game is to guess 5 letter words within 6 guesses.
1. Any letters that you guess that also correspond to the same position of the word to guess will appear as green on both the keyboard and the board box. This lets you know a letter is correct in your guess position and the word to guess position. 
2. If a letter is found in the guess word but in the wrong positon, this letter will appear yellow on both the keyboard and the board box. Informing you that this letter you guessed is within the word to guess just not in the right spot. Try again with this letter in a different position!
3. If any letter you guess isn't contained within the word to guess these boxes become grayed out on the board and the keyboard letters will also be grayed out. Don't use these letters in future guesses as you know the word doesn't contain it!
4. These are the basic rules to the game. The win condition is to guess the word correctly within 6 guesses. If the player fails to guess the word in 6 guesses the player will lose.
